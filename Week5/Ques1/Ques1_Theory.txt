Java Byte Stream Classes
Byte stream is defined by using two abstract class at the top of hierarchy, they are InputStream and OutputStream.

byte stream classification

These two abstract classes have several concrete classes that handle various devices such as disk files, network connection etc.


BufferedInputStream	Used for Buffered Input Stream.
BufferedOutputStream	Used for Buffered Output Stream.
DataInputStream	Contains method for reading java standard datatype
DataOutputStream	An output stream that contain method for writing java standard data type
FileInputStream	Input stream that reads from a file
FileOutputStream	Output stream that write to a file.
InputStream	Abstract class that describe stream input.
OutputStream	Abstract class that describe stream output.
PrintStream	Output Stream that contain print() and println() method
These classes define several key methods. Two most important are

read() : reads byte of data.
write() : Writes byte of data.
